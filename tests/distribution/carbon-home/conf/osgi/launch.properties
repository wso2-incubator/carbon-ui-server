# When osgi.clean is set to "true", any cached data used by the OSGi framework
# will be wiped clean. This will clean the caches used to store bundle
# dependency resolution and eclipse extension registry data. Using this
# option will force OSGi framework to reinitialize these caches.
# The following setting is put in place to create rid of the problems
# faced when re-starting the system. Please note that, when this setting is
# true, if you manually start a bundle, it would not be available when
# you re-start the system. To avid this, copy the bundle jar to the plugins
# folder, before you re-start the system.
